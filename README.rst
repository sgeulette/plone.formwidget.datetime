Introduction
============

The package plone.formwidget.datetime provides date and time widgets for plone
to be used with z3c.form and Archetypes. The calendar widget is based on
JQueryTools Dateinput, provided by plone.app.jquerytools.

The package is a merge of collective.z3cform.datetimewidget
and archetypes.datetimewidget (which itself was derived from
collective.z3cform.datetimewidget).
